# How to contribute

### ‚ùó **Common mistakes**

-   Please do not try to contribute with formatting the code purely for aesthetic reasons since this won't have an effect on the product's functionality, most likely PRs like this will not be accepted.
-   Opening a pull request without a description or a proper name is not fun for the reviewer, so try to explain your change as much as possible either by text or a code snippet.
-   Adding new dependencies or modifying the `package.json` will most likely be not accepted or will be accepted in a long time since adding a new dependency to the codebase can be tricky.
-   Not linting your code using the configuration given by the project would result in a change request. Please be aware that your code is not wrong, it is just **wrongly linted**.
-   This codespace uses `pnpm`, so please try to respect the choice and try to use it.
